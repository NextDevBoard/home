I am pleased to annouce that my project went live on Kickstarter.com at 3 pm.  I am asking my supporters to help me achieve 40 backers in the first 24 hours.   Doing so may result in the project becoming a "Staff Pick" on the Kickstarter site.   

Here is the [link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/772515070/nextdev-a-user-interface-device-for-the-iot).

Also, please help spread the word on social media!

Thanks in advance,
Guy
