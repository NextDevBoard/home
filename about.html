                I build custom web applications for small businesses and startups. I handle everything from
                analyzing business requirements to app development and hosting.

            <p>
                I've been writing software since I was in grade school, continually evolving my skills.
                Some stops along the way:

                <li>Desktop application with classic Windows (3.1) API and later MFC</li>
                <li>Banking applications and data analysis in Microsoft Access and Visual Basic</li>

                If you want to talk about a project, or you just have a coding question:
                
                <div style='text-align:center'>
                    <a class='btn' href='/contact.html'>Get in touch with me</a>
